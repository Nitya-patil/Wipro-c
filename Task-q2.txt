Point2D (Java) - Create a class Point2D with x and y coordinates. Overload the + operator to return a new Point2D object representing the sum of two points.

#include <iostream>

class Point2D {
private:
    double x;
    double y;

public:
    
    Point2D(double a, double b){
        x = a;
        y= b;
    }

    
    Point2D operator+(const Point2D other) const {   // Overload operator +
        return Point2D(x + other.x, y + other.y);
    }

    
    friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, const Point2D& point) {    // Overload operator <<
        os << "(" << point.x << ", " << point.y << ")";
        return os;
    }
};

int main() {
    Point2D p1(1.0, 2.0);
    Point2D p2(3.0, 4.0);

    Point2D sum = p1 + p2;
    std::cout << "Sum of " << p1 << " and " << p2 << " is " << sum << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
